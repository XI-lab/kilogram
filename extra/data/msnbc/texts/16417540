Saban leaves <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins> for <Alabama|Alabama> job
Coach ends speculation, takes offer of 8 years, $32 million — all guaranteed

<Davie,_Florida|DAVIE>, <Florida|Fla.> - <Nick_Saban|Nick_Saban> is ’<Alabama|Bama> bound.

Ending five weeks of denials and two days of deliberation, <Nick_Saban|Saban> accepted the <Alabama|Alabama> coaching job and abandoned his bid to rebuild the <Miami_Dolphins|Miami_Dolphins> after only two seasons.

ESPN said the deal is for eight years and $32 million, all of it guaranteed.

<Miami_Dolphins|Miami> owner <Wayne_Huizenga|Wayne_Huizenga> said he was informed of the decision in a meeting Wednesday at <Nick_Saban|Saban’s> house. <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> announced the departure at a news conference that <Nick_Saban|Saban> didn’t attend.

“It is what it is,” <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> said, borrowing <Nick_Saban|Saban’s> pet phrase. “I’m not upset because it’s more involved than what you think.”

Since late November, <Nick_Saban|Saban> had issued frequent, angry public denials of interest in moving to <Tuscaloosa,_Alabama|Tuscaloosa>. <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> said the change of heart wasn’t driven by money, and <Nick_Saban|Saban> never sought a raise or contract extension.

Instead, <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> hinted that family issues for <Nick_Saban|Saban> and his wife, Terry, were a factor.

“I’ve been through this with <Nick_Saban|Nick> for quite some time now, and I feel the pain and so forth and so on of <Nick_Saban|Nick> and Terry, and it’s not a very simple thing,” <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> said. “I think <Nick_Saban|Nick’s> great. I’ll be <Nick_Saban|Nick’s> biggest fan. I’ll be cheering for him to win that bowl game.”

A preference for the college game and the campus lifestyle may have swayed <Nick_Saban|Saban>. He won a national championship at <Louisiana_State_University|LSU> and is 15-17 with the <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins>. This was his first losing season in 13 years as a head coach.

The <University_of_Alabama|Crimson_Tide> first approached <Nick_Saban|Saban> shortly after firing <Mike_Shula|Mike_Shula>. <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> has said he received repeated assurances from <Nick_Saban|Saban> that he would return in 2007, and two weeks ago <Nick_Saban|Saban> said: “I’m not going to be the <Alabama|Alabama> coach.”

But when the <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins’> 6-10 season ended Sunday, <Alabama|Alabama> sweetened an offer that reportedly would make him the highest-paid coach in college football. He had three years remaining on his <Miami_Dolphins|Miami> contract at $4.5 million a year.

In the past, <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> has been persuasive when dealing with coaches. He talked <Don_Shula|Don_Shula> into retirement in 1996, talked <Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)|Jimmy_Johnson> out of retiring three years later — <Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)|Johnson> lasted one more season — and was able to lure <Nick_Saban|Saban> to the pros in 2004 after other <National_Football_League|NFL> teams had failed.

But this time, <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> failed to change <Nick_Saban|Saban’s> mind.

After <Nick_Saban|Saban> turned down the <University_of_Alabama|Tide> in early December, <Alabama|Alabama> offered the job to <Rich_Rodriguez|Rich_Rodriguez>, but he decided to stay at <West_Virginia_University|West_Virginia>. <Alabama|Alabama> lost last week to <Oklahoma_State|Oklahoma_State> in the <Independence_Bowl|Independence_Bowl> to finish 6-7.

Possible candidates to replace <Nick_Saban|Saban> include <Chicago_Bears|Chicago_Bears> defensive coordinator <Ron_Rivera|Ron_Rivera>, former <Green_Bay_Packers|Green_Bay> head coach <Mike_Sherman|Mike_Sherman>, <San_Diego_Chargers|San_Diego_Chargers> offensive coordinator <Cam_Cameron|Cam_Cameron>, <Indianapolis_Colts|Indianapolis> assistant <Jim_Caldwell_(football_coach)|Jim_Caldwell>, <Tennessee_Titans|Tennessee_Titans> offensive coordinator <Norm_Chow|Norm_Chow> and <Pittsburgh_Steelers|Pittsburgh_Steelers> assistants <Russ_Grimm|Russ_Grimm> and Ken Whisenhut.

<Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> didn’t rule out hiring a college coach, as he did when <Nick_Saban|Saban> came to the <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins> from <Louisiana_State_University|LSU> two years ago.

“There’s only one thing I want to do, and it’s win,” <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> said. “I don’t care what it takes, what it costs, what’s involved, we’re going to make this a winning franchise. It’s no fun owning a team if you’re not winning, I can tell you that. And we are absolutely, positively going to get back to being a winning team. And sooner rather than later.”

Leading the search for a coach will be Joe Bailey, chief executive officer of <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins> Enterprises, and Brian Wiedmeier, the <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins’> president and chief operating officer. The <Arizona_Cardinals|Arizona_Cardinals> and <Atlanta_Falcons|Atlanta_Falcons> are also seeking a new coach.

The <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins’> next coach will be their fourth in nine seasons.

“I wish you hadn’t brought that up,” <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> said with a wry smile.

It has been a frustrating a stretch of instability for a franchise that had the same coach — <Mike_Shula|Shula> — for 26 years. <Miami_Dolphins|Miami> has failed to make the playoffs the past five years, a team record.

The <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins> are coming off their third losing season since 1969 and likely face a roster overhaul. With <Daunte_Culpepper|Daunte_Culpepper> struggling to recover from reconstructive knee surgery in 2005, <Miami_Dolphins|Miami> remains unsettled at quarterback, a troublesome position since <Dan_Marino|Dan_Marino> retired seven years ago. The team needs upgrades in almost every other area for a feeble offense and aging defense.

<Nick_Saban|Saban> leaves behind the <National_Football_League|NFL’s> largest staff of assistants and general manager Randy Mueller, who might be given more responsibility under a new coaching regime.

The <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins> haven’t reached the <AFC_Championship_Game|AFC_championship_game> since <Wayne_Huizenga|Huizenga> became majority owner in 1994.

“All I want to figure out is how the heck we’re going to win,” he said. “And that’s what everyone with the <Miami_Dolphins|Dolphins> wants, to win. So win, win, win. That’s all I can say. We’re going to go out there and kick some butt and make something happen, I guarantee you.”
