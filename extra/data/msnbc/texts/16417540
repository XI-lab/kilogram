TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - <Nick_Saban|Nick_Saban> couldn't escape his college roots, so he quit trying.
<Nick_Saban|Saban> was introduced as <Alabama|Alabama's> coach on Thursday, touting his championship aspirations and citing his love of college football as a reason for taking a pay cut to leave the <Miami_Dolphins|Miami_Dolphins>.
In other words, he said the things <University_of_Alabama|Crimson_Tide> fans most wanted to hear.
"My heart's here. I love it here," he said. "I like to affect people, and that's why I'm here. This is obviously one of the best places in the country to have an opportunity to do that."
Taking over a program with a rich tradition led by the late coach Bear Bryant, who won five national titles, <Nick_Saban|Saban> refused to dwell in the past.
"It's what you do now," he said.
His resume features the one thing <Alabama|Alabama> fans hunger for most: A national title. His "championship credentials" - as athletic director Mal Moore put it - are why the <University_of_Alabama|Tide> was willing to offer a reported eight-year deal worth an estimated $32 million plus incentives, the richest in college football.
"I know there's tremendous expectations here," <Nick_Saban|Saban> said. "I can tell you that, however you feel about it, I have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish. I want to win every game we play."
<Nick_Saban|Saban> led <Alabama|Alabama> divisional rival <Louisiana_State_University|LSU> to a national title in 2003 and two SEC championships before heading to <Miami_Dolphins|Miami>.

"His teams always play with confidence and pride and I know that in order to win a national championship, a team has to be mentally as well as physically tough," said Moore, who played and coached under Bryant. "Coach <Nick_Saban|Saban's> teams have always possessed those qualities."
As for the big salary, Moore said, "I just think it was a very crucial hire for us in this time in our history."

"That certainly makes a strong statement in a state that funds education at one of the lowest per-pupil rates of any state in the country," said state Rep. Richard Lindsey, D-Centre, chairman of a House committee that writes the education budget. "I think we've let it get out of hand."
But the school's faculty senate president, chemistry professor John Vincent, had a more positive view.

Vincent said having a high-profile coach like <Nick_Saban|Saban> would create more interest in the University of <Alabama|Alabama>, which would bring more interest and money to the academic side.
<Nick_Saban|Saban> said his first goals were to hire a coaching staff and work on completing the <University_of_Alabama|Tide's> recruiting class. He has already hired Florida State assistant Kevin Steele to be his defensive coordinator, according to Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden.
<Nick_Saban|Saban's> success attracting top prep players is evident. Quarterback JaMarcus Russell, receiver Early Doucet and safety LaRon Landry - who all played key roles in <Louisiana_State_University|LSU's> 41-14 Sugar Bowl victory over Notre Dame on Wednesday night - were among players he brought to Baton Rouge.
<Nick_Saban|Saban's> wife, Terry, encouraged the move to <Tuscaloosa,_Alabama|Tuscaloosa> and another college job.

And the warm reception on Wednesday afternoon didn't hurt, either. <Nick_Saban|Saban> said when he arrived at <Louisiana_State_University|LSU> from Michigan State as a less well-known coach, it was just him, an equipment manager and his agent.
Not this time.
"When the plane landed, we were overwhelmed that there was this huge crowd of people just cheering, like your mother's saying, 'Come on home,"' Terry <Nick_Saban|Saban> said.
The well-traveled <Nick_Saban|Saban> also said he intends for this to be his final coaching stop before retiring to Lake Burton in north Georgia, where he has a home.
"That's where I like it, and that's my next stop," the 55-year-old <Nick_Saban|Saban> said.
