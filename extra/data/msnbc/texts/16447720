Mourners in <Michigan|Michigan> welcome body of <Gerald_Ford|Ford>
Ex-president 'who meant so much' scheduled to be buried Wednesday

<Grand_Rapids,_Michigan|GRAND_RAPIDS>, <Michigan|Mich.> - Moving quietly and solemnly through the moonlight, mourners waited for a chance to file past the casket of <Gerald_Ford|Gerald_R._Ford>, welcoming home the 38th president for a final time and celebrating a man they said embodied <Midwestern_United_States|Midwest> values.

“This is a once-in-lifetime opportunity to pay tribute,” said Karin Lewis, 44, who brought her five boys, ages 6 to 15, to <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> presidential museum to pay respects Tuesday night. “He meant so much to this community.”

<Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> state funeral was to end Wednesday afternoon after a service at Grace Episcopal Church in East <Grand_Rapids,_Michigan|Grand_Rapids>. His body was to be interred during a private burial overlooking the <Grand_River_(<Michigan|Michigan>)|Grand_River> north of the museum on the museum grounds.

<Donald_Rumsfeld|Donald_Rumsfeld>, who served in <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> cabinet as his chief of staff and as his defense secretary, was to deliver a eulogy. Former <Jimmy_Carter|President_Jimmy_Carter>, who defeated <Gerald_Ford|Ford> in 1976 but later became a close friend of his former opponent, and <Richard_Norton_Smith|Richard_Norton_Smith>, who used to be the director of the <Gerald_Ford|Ford> museum and presidential library, also were scheduled to speak.

Final salute
On Tuesday, members of the public jammed streets and waved as <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> casket was carried from the <Grand_Rapids_Airport|Grand_Rapids_airport>, where it arrived following services at <Washington_National_Cathedral|Washington_National_Cathedral>.

“You were a paradoxical gift of remarkable intellect and achievement wrapped in a plain brown wrapper,” <Michigan|Michigan> Gov. <Jennifer_Granholm|Jennifer_Granholm> said of <Gerald_Ford|Ford>. “Welcome home to the people that you reflected so well when you were in <Washington_National_Cathedral|Washington>.”

Later, members of the public walked from the <DeVos_Place_Convention_Center|DeVos_Place_convention_center> across a bridge over the <Grand_River_(<Michigan|Michigan>)|Grand_River> to the <Gerald_R._Ford_Presidential_Library|Gerald_R._Ford_Presidential_Library_and_Museum> for a final salute.

Some wore formal suits and dresses. Others wore sweat shirts from <University_of_Michigan|University_of_Michigan>, where <Gerald_Ford|Ford> played center on the <Michigan_Wolverines|Wolverines>’ undefeated national championship football teams of 1932 and 1933.

“I grew up in <Grand_Rapids,_Michigan|Grand_Rapids>, and <Gerald_Ford|President_Ford> was our legacy,” said Bobbe Taber, 43, who now lives in the <Kalamazoo_River|Kalamazoo> area but came to <Grand_Rapids,_Michigan|Grand_Rapids> to see <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> casket.

<United_States_National_Guard|Michigan_National_Guard> spokeswoman Lynn Chapp said 60,000 people were expected to walk by the casket from the time repose began around 6 p.m. Tuesday until it was scheduled to end at 11 a.m. Wednesday. Lines snaked along several blocks in the city’s downtown as people waited their turn Tuesday night.

'The best of <United_States|America'>
The service Wednesday at his hometown church, which seats about 350, was to be much smaller than Tuesday’s elaborate national funeral service in <Washington_National_Cathedral|Washington>, which drew 3,000 people. <George_H._W._Bush|President_Bush> and his father spoke Tuesday, as did <NBC|NBC> newsman <Tom_Brokaw|Tom_Brokaw> and <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> secretary of state, <Henry_Kissinger|Henry_Kissinger>, among others.

“In <Gerald_Ford|President_Ford>, the world saw the best of <United_States|America>, and <United_States|America> found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our nation’s history,” <George_H._W._Bush|President_Bush> said in his eulogy.

<George_W._Bush|Bush’s> father, the first <George_H._W._Bush|President_Bush>, called <Gerald_Ford|Ford> a “<Norman_Rockwell|Norman_Rockwell> painting come to life” and pierced the solemnity of the occasion by cracking gentle jokes about <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> reputation as an errant golfer. He said <Gerald_Ford|Ford> knew his golf game was getting better when he began hitting fewer spectators.

Under towering arches of the cathedral, <Henry_Kissinger|Kissinger> paid tribute to <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> leadership in achieving nuclear arms control with the <Soviet_Union|Soviets>, pushing for the first political agreement between <Israel|Israel> and <Egypt|Egypt> and helping to bring majority rule to <southern_Africa|southern_Africa>.

“In his understated way he did his duty as a leader, not as a performer playing to the gallery,” <Henry_Kissinger|Kissinger> said. “<Gerald_Ford|Gerald_Ford> had the virtues of small town <United_States|America>.”

<Tom_Brokaw|Brokaw> said in his eulogy that <Gerald_Ford|Ford> brought to office “no demons, no hidden agenda, no hit list or acts of vengeance,” an oblique reference to the air of subterfuge that surrounded <Richard_Nixon|Nixon> in his final days.

<Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> athletic interest was honored, too, in the capital and in <Michigan|Michigan>. At the <Grand_Rapids_Airport|Grand_Rapids_airport> that bears <Gerald_Ford|Ford>’s name, the <University_of_Michigan|University_of_Michigan> band played the school’s famous fight song, “<The_Victors|The_Victors>,” as <Gerald_Ford|Ford’s> flag-draped casket was transferred to a hearse.

<Gerald_Ford|Ford> died at 93 on Dec. 26 at his home in <Rancho_Mirage,_California|Rancho_Mirage>, <California|Calif.>
