<London|LONDON> - Thousands of airline passengers still have not received their luggage after fog disrupted flights at <London_Heathrow_Airport|London's_Heathrow_Airport> late last year, airline officials said Wednesday.
    
The chaos was compounded when faults developed with a baggage belt at <Heathrow,_London|Heathrow's> Terminal 4, said <British_Airways|British_Airways>, the airline that was worst affected.
<British_Airways|BA> said Wednesday it still had "several thousand" bags that have not been delivered to their owners.
Many are still stacked at <Heathrow,_London|Heathrow's> Terminal 1 and Terminal 4, and <British_Airways|BA> is now using freight planes and volunteers to deliver them to their owners.
The problem began before the Christmas holiday with a fault on a baggage belt at Terminal 4, a <British_Airways|BA> spokesman said on condition of anonymity. That caused an initial backlog, and about 8,000 bags were not delivered, he said.
The fog at <Heathrow,_London|Heathrow> caused further problems, and there was another Terminal 4 baggage belt problem on Dec. 29 - leading to about 10,000 bags being undelivered, the spokesman said.
Over the holiday season, the airline dealt with about 75,000 bags a day at <Heathrow,_London|Heathrow> and handled about 1 million passengers, the spokesman said.
The baggage problem coincided with changes in working practices for <British_Airways|BA> baggage handlers at Terminals 1 and 4, before the airline's planned move to Terminal 5 in March 2008, he said.
