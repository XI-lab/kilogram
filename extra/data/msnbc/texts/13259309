<Nouri_al-Maliki|Al-Maliki> adviser says official who supervised execution is target of probe

<Baghdad|BAGHDAD>, <Iraq|Iraq> - <Iraq|Iraq’s> national security adviser told <NBC_News|NBC_News> on Wednesday that three individuals have been arrested in connection with a video of <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam_Hussein’s> execution that was leaked.

“I can officially now confirm the arrest of three individuals in the case of the execution of <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam_Hussein>,” said <Iraq|Iraqi> national security adviser <Mouwafak_al-Rabii|Mowaffak_al-Rubaie>.

The arrests came after the announcement that officials were interrogating the person suspected of recording <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam’s> hanging via a mobile phone.

“The person who filmed the execution process has been arrested. ... Now he is under interrogation about the goals of his filming,” said an adviser to the prime minister, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. “He was arrested by <New_Iraqi_Army|Iraqi_forces>.”

The video contained audio of witnesses telling <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam> to “Go to hell” and of the former leader responding to taunts that his tormentors were being unmanly. It surfaced on <Al_Jazeera|Al-Jazeera> television and the <Internet|Internet> late Saturday, the day <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam> was hanged.

<The_Associated_Press|The_Associated_Press> quoted an unidentified adviser to Prime Minister <Nouri_al-Maliki|Nouri_al-Maliki> as saying the man arrested was “an official who supervised the execution.”

<Nouri_al-Maliki|Al-Maliki> announced Tuesday that he had ordered an investigation into the conduct of the execution team, who could be heard taunting <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam> in the moments before his hanging.

A <Military_of_the_United_States|U.S._military> spokesman, meanwhile, said the <United_States|United_States> would have handled the execution differently had it been in charge.

‘I did not see him taking pictures’
On Wednesday, an <Iraq|Iraqi> prosecutor who was also present at the execution denied a report that he had accused national security adviser <Mouwafak_al-Rabii|al-Rubaie> of possible responsibility for the leaked video.

“I am not accusing <Mouwafak_al-Rabii|Mowaffak_al-Rubaie>, and I did not see him taking pictures,” Munqith al-Faroon, a prosecutor in the case that sent <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam> to the gallows, told <The_Associated_Press|The_Associated_Press>.

“But I saw two of the government officials who were ... present during the execution taking all the video of the execution, using the lights that were there for the official taping of the execution. They used mobile phone cameras. I do not know their names, but I would remember their faces,” al-Faroon said in a telephone interview.

The prosecutor said the two officials were openly taking video pictures, which are believed to be those which appeared on <Al_Jazeera|Al-Jazeera> satellite and a <Website|Web_site> within hours of <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam’s> execution.

The <New_York_Times|New_York_Times> on Wednesday reported that al-Faroon told the newspaper “one of two men he had seen holding a cell phone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. <Saddam_Hussein|Hussein’s> last moments up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor was <Mouwafak_al-Rabii|Mowaffak_al-Rubaie>, Mr. <Nouri_al-Maliki|Maliki’s> national security adviser.”

The <New_York_Times|Times> said it had been unable to reach <Mouwafak_al-Rabii|al-Rubaie> for comment. <Associated_Press|AP> also could not reach him Wednesday. His secretary said the security adviser, a close aide to <Nouri_al-Maliki|al-Maliki>, was in <Najaf|Najaf> and would not return until later.

Chants of ‘<Muqtada_al-Sadr|Muqtada>’
Al-Faroon said there were 14 <Iraq|Iraqi> officials, including himself and another prosecutor, as well as three hangmen present for the execution. All the officials, he said, were flown by <United_States|U.S.> helicopter to the former military intelligence facility where <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam> was put to death in an execution chamber used by his own security men for years.

The prosecutor said he believed all mobile phones had been confiscated before the flight and that some of the officials’ bodyguards, who arrived by car, had smuggled the camera phones to the two officials he had seen taking the video pictures.

<Al_Arabiya|Al-Arabiya> television reported that the person under arrest is one of the guards who was a member of the execution team, according to an <MSNBC|MSNBC> translator. There was no further information about whether the person under arrest was a guard or other official.

Some of the last words <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam> heard, according to the leaked cell phone video, were a chant of “<Muqtada_al-Sadr|Muqtada>, Muqtada, <Muqtada_al-Sadr|Muqtada>,” a reference to <Muqtada_al-Sadr|Muqtada_al-Sadr>, the radical anti-American Shiite cleric, whose <Mahdi_Army|Mahdi_Army> militia is believed responsible for many killings that have targeted <Sunni_Islam|Sunnis> and driven many from their homes.

<Muqtada_al-Sadr|Al-Sadr’s> father was killed by <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam>. The militant cleric is a key <Nouri_al-Maliki|al-Maliki> backer.

<United_States|U.S.> response
Maj. Gen. <William_B._Caldwell|William_Caldwell>, a <Military_of_the_United_States|U.S._military> spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that the execution would have been handled differently had <Military_of_the_United_States|U.S._forces> been in charge.

“If you are asking me: ‘Would we have done things differently?’ Yes, we would have. But that’s not our decision. That’s the government of <Iraq|Iraq’s> decision,” he .

He added that <Saddam_Hussein|Saddam> was “dignified” and “courteous” as he was transferred from <Military_of_the_United_States|US_military> control to <Iraq|Iraqi> custody before he was executed.

“He spoke very well to our military police, as he always had, and when getting off at the prison site he said farewell to his interpreter; he thanked the military police squad,” <William_B._Caldwell|Caldwell> said.
