<Buckhannon,_West_Virginia|BUCKHANNON>, <West_Virginia|W._Va>. - One year ago Tuesday, the nation was holding its breath for 13 miners who were trapped deep inside the <Sago_Mine_disaster|Sago_Mine> near <Buckhannon,_West_Virginia|Buckhannon>, <West_Virginia|W._Va>.
    
As it turned out, 12 of the 13 miners never made it out alive.
In <West_Virginia|West_Virginia> Tuesday, <Randal_McCloy|Randal_McCloy>, the lone survivor of the disaster, joined the families of the 12 men who died - to remember them and the nightmare that began one year ago.
"I'm just sick when I think - every day when I think how those men had to die and it makes me sick," says Debbie Hamner whose husband died in the mine.
Since <Sago_Mine_disaster|Sago>, both <West_Virginia|West_Virginia> and the federal government have passed new mine safety laws. But in the mines themselves, little has changed.
Davitt McAteer is a mine safety expert who once ran the government's Mine Safety and Health Administration and led <West_Virginia|West_Virginia's> <Sago_Mine_disaster|Sago_Mine> investigation.
"We need to have a way to communicate with trapped miners," McAteer says. "We need to protect trapped miners until we can get to them, and we need to have a way that we can provide them with the breathing apparatus and the air system so they can stay alive."  
What has changed in mine safety since the <Sago_Mine_disaster|Sago> tragedy:  
Still not required, though are underground emergency safe rooms.
The union representing many of the nation's 73,000 coal miners says it's a sign of priorities.
"There's still just an attitude out there that production comes first and safety is a convenient thing and it comes second," says Dennis O'Dell of <United_Mine_Workers|United_Mine_Workers_of_America>.
These are boom times for the coal industry, producing a record 1.17 billion tons of coal in 2006, but also the highest death toll in 11 years.
