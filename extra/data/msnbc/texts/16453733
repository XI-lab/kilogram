Barbara <Barbara_Walters|Walters> stands by Rosie O’Donnell
‘View’ host denies <Donald_Trump|Trump's> claim she wanted comedian off morning show

<New_York_City|NEW_YORK> - <Barbara_Walters|Barbara_Walters> is back from vacation — and she’s standing by Rosie O’Donnell in her bitter battle of words with <Donald_Trump|Donald_Trump>.

<Barbara_Walters|Walters>, creator of <American_Broadcasting_Company|ABC’s> “<The_View|The_View>,” said Wednesday on the daytime chat show that she never told <Donald_Trump|Trump> she didn’t want O’Donnell on the show, as he has claimed. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” she said.

“She has brought a new vitality to this show and the ratings prove it,” <Barbara_Walters|Walters> said of O’Donnell, who is on vacation this week. When she returns, <Barbara_Walters|Walters> said, “We will all welcome her back with open arms.”

<Barbara_Walters|Walters> also took a moment to smooth things over with <Donald_Trump|The_Donald>, who got all riled up when O’Donnell said on “<The_View|The_View”> that he had been “bankrupt so many times.”

“<American_Broadcasting_Company|ABC> has asked me to say this just to clarify things, and I will quote: ‘<Donald_Trump|Donald_Trump> has never filed for personal bankruptcy. Several of his casino companies have filed for business bankruptcies. They are out of bankruptcy now,”’ <Barbara_Walters|Walters> said.

O’Donnell and <Donald_Trump|Trump> have been feuding since he announced last month that <Miss_USA|Miss_USA> Tara <Tara_Conner|Conner>, whose title had been in jeopardy because of underage drinking, would keep her crown. <Donald_Trump|Trump> is the owner of the <Miss_Universe_Organization|Miss_Universe_Organization>, which includes <Miss_USA|Miss_USA> and <Miss_Teen_USA|Miss_Teen_USA>.

The 44-year-old outspoken moderator of “<The_View|The_View>,” who joined the show in September, said <Donald_Trump|Trump’s> news conference with <Tara_Conner|Conner> had annoyed her “on a multitude of levels” and that the twice-divorced real estate mogul had no right to be “the moral compass for 20-year-olds in <United_States|America>.”

<Donald_Trump|Trump> fired back, calling O’Donnell a “loser” and a “bully,” among other insults, in various media interviews.

He is the host of <NBC|NBC’s> “<The_Apprentice|The_Apprentice>,” which begins its new season Sunday.
