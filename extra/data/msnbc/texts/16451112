Home Depot CEO <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> quits
Home-improvement retailer's chief executive had been criticized over pay

<Atlanta,_Georgia|ATLANTA> - <Robert_Nardelli|Bob_Nardelli> abruptly resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive of <Home_Depot|The_Home_Depot_Inc.> after a six-year tenure that saw the world’s largest home improvement store chain post big profits but left investors disheartened by poor stock performance.

<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> has also been under fire by investors for his hefty pay and is leaving with a severance package valued at about $210 million. He became CEO in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at <General_Electric|General_Electric_Co.>, where <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> had been a senior executive.

<Home_Depot|Home_Depot> said <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> was being replaced by <Frank_Blake|Frank_Blake>, its vice chairman, effective immediately.

<Frank_Blake|Blake’s> appointment is permanent, <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> spokesman Jerry <Jerry_Shields|Shields> said. What he will be paid was not immediately disclosed, <Jerry_Shields|Shields> said. The company declined to make <Frank_Blake|Blake> available for comment, and a message left for <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> with his secretary was not immediately returned.

Before Wednesday’s news, <Home_Depot|Home_Depot’s> stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> took over.

<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli’s> sudden departure was stunning in that he told <The_Associated_Press|The_Associated_Press> as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director also said that the board was pleased with <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> despite the uproar by some investors.

Asked in that interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving <Home_Depot|Home_Depot>, <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> said unequivocally that he hadn’t. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> said, “Selling hammers.”

For <Home_Depot|The_Home_Depot>?

“Absolutely,” he said at the time.

<Home_Depot|Home_Depot> said <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli’s> decision to resign was by mutual agreement with the <Atlanta,_Georgia|Atlanta-based> company.

“We are very grateful to <Robert_Nardelli|Bob> for his strong leadership of <Home_Depot|The_Home_Depot> over the past six years. Under <Robert_Nardelli|Bob’s> tenure, the company made significant and necessary investments that greatly improved the company’s infrastructure and operations, expanded our markets to include wholesale distribution and new geographies, and undertook key strategic initiatives to strengthen the company’s foundation for the future,” <Home_Depot|Home_Depot’s> board said in a statement.

<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> was a nuts-and-bolts leader, a former college football player and friend of <George_H._W._Bush|President_Bush>. He helped increase revenue and profits at <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> and increase the number of stores the company operates to more than 2,000. <Home_Depot|Home_Depot’s> earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company’s stock price had become a distraction.

Industry experts and analysts said his departure and <Frank_Blake|Blake’s> ascent to the top job are a good thing for <Home_Depot|Home_Depot>.

“This is not about strategy or vision,” said James Senn, director of <J._Mack_Robinson_College_of_Business|Robinson_College’s> Center for Global Business Leadership at <Georgia_State_University|Georgia_State_University>. “This is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. <Robert_Nardelli|Bob> has run into some problems there. The second is execution.”

<Home_Depot|The_Home_Depot> board also announced that Carol Tome, its chief financial officer, and Joe DeAngelo, its executive vice president for <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> Supply, will be assuming additional responsibilities.

Tome will be assuming responsibility for mergers and acquisitions, credit services and additional strategic responsibilities. DeAngelo was appointed to the newly created position of chief operating officer.

<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> and <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> have agreed to terms of a separation agreement that would provide for payment of the amounts he is entitled to receive under his pre-existing employment contract entered into in 2000. Under this agreement, <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> will receive consideration currently valued at about $210 million.

The package includes a cash severance payment of $20 million, the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at approximately $77 million and unvested options with an intrinsic value of approximately $7 million. It also includes payments of earned bonuses and long-term incentive awards of approximately $9 million, account balances under the Company’s 401(k) plan and other benefit programs currently valued at approximately $2 million, previously earned and vested deferred shares with an approximate value of $44 million, the present value of retirement benefits currently valued at approximately $32 million and $18 million for other entitlements under his contract. Those entitlements will be paid over a four-year period and will be forfeited if he does not honor his contractual obligations.

<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> has also agreed not to compete with the company for one year, and not to solicit employees or customers of the company for four years.

<Home_Depot|Home_Depot> did not say what <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> would be doing next.

In conjunction with the management changes, the board also announced that it had waived the retirement age of 72 and has asked John L. Clendenin, Claudio X. Gonzales and Milledge A. Hart III to stand for re-election at the 2007 annual shareholders meeting. This action was taken to retain these directors’ experience. <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> said the action was temporary.
