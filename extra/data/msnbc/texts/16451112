<Atlanta,_Georgia|ATLANTA> - <Robert_Nardelli|Bob_Nardelli> said he had no intention of stepping down. His board said it didn't want anybody else. But in the end, analysts said, the criticism over <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli's> hefty pay and <Home_Depot|The_Home_Depot_Inc.'s> poor stock performance forced a change of heart.
    
<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> abruptly resigned as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest home improvement store chain after six years at the helm, the company said Wednesday.
He didn't leave empty-handed: the <Atlanta,_Georgia|Atlanta-based> company said <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> would receive a severance package worth roughly $210 million, an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors.
"It's a sign of being totally out of touch," said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. "They don't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry."
Frank said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives. At <Home_Depot|Home_Depot's> annual meeting last May, shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected.
<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli's> severance package includes a cash payment of $20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $77 million. A <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> spokesman said the timing of the resignation, which was effective Tuesday, had no bearing on the amount in the package.
The total package is seven times the $30 million <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service. <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.
<Home_Depot|Home_Depot> said <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> was being replaced by <Frank_Blake|Frank_Blake>, its vice chairman, effective immediately.
<Home_Depot|Home_Depot> co-founder Bernie Marcus, who had a hand in hiring <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli>, said he supports the board's decision to replace <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> with <Frank_Blake|Blake>.
"My concern is what happens in the future, and I feel very good about it," said Marcus, who no longer works for <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> in any official capacity but remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders.
Asked about the severance payout, Marcus said the amount won't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company's stock price improves.
"It's like the old story, if the stock goes up 10 points, who's going to care?" Marcus said.
<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli>, a former college football player, became CEO of <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at <General_Electric|General_Electric_Co.>, where <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> had been a senior executive.
<Frank_Blake|Blake's> appointment is permanent, <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> spokesman Jerry <Jerry_Shields|Shields> said. The company declined to make <Frank_Blake|Blake> available for comment, and messages left for <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> with his secretary and on his wife's cell phone were not immediately returned.
<Home_Depot|Home_Depot> shares rose 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $41.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, near the upper end of their 52-week range of $32.85 to $43.95. Before Wednesday's news, <Home_Depot|Home_Depot's> stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> took over.
<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli's> sudden departure was stunning in that he told <The_Associated_Press|The_Associated_Press> as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director said that the board was pleased with <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> despite the uproar by some investors. That director, Bonnie Hill, did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles.
Asked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving <Home_Depot|Home_Depot>, <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> said unequivocally that he hadn't. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> said, "Selling hammers."
For <Home_Depot|The_Home_Depot>?
"Absolutely," he said at the time.
Marcus said he had no idea <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli's> resignation was coming.
"Obviously, something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli's> mind about staying," Marcus said.
<Home_Depot|Home_Depot> said <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli's> decision to resign was by mutual agreement with <Home_Depot|Home_Depot>.
"We are very grateful to <Robert_Nardelli|Bob> for his strong leadership of <Home_Depot|The_Home_Depot> over the past six years," <Home_Depot|Home_Depot's> board said in a statement.
<Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> was a nuts-and-bolts leader. He helped increase revenue and profits at <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> and increase the number of stores the company operates. <Home_Depot|Home_Depot's> earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company's stock price became a distraction.
As of the end of 2005, <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> had earned $123.7 million in compensation excluding certain stock option grants since becoming CEO. His compensation for 2006 has not yet been disclosed.
Industry experts and analysts said his departure and <Frank_Blake|Blake's> ascent to the top job are a good thing for <Home_Depot|Home_Depot>.
"This is not about strategy or vision," said James Senn, director of <J._Mack_Robinson_College_of_Business|Robinson_College's> Center for Global Business Leadership at <Georgia_State_University|Georgia_State_University>. "This is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. <Robert_Nardelli|Bob> has run into some problems there. The second is execution."
Edward Jones analyst Stephanie Hoff said she views the developments at <Home_Depot|Home_Depot> as a sign that there was a need for change at the top, not a change in the company's strategy.
"I think his gruff demeanor, while some people would consider that refreshing, sometimes hurt him," Hoff said, adding that <Frank_Blake|Blake> is considered by some as more articulate and polished.
She added, "I think the board basically was looking at this situation and figured <Robert_Nardelli|Nardelli> had become such a lightning rod for criticism of his pay package."
