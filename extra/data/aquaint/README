Introduction
=====================================

The AQUAINT dataset was originally constructed by Milne and Witten in their work "Learning to Link with Wikipedia" in CIKM'08. The dataset is a subset of 50 documents from the AQUAINT text corpus: a collection of newswire stories. There are totally 50 documents with 727 mentions in the dataset. Details can be found in their paper.

The dataset can be found in the website: http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/download_view/Wikifier

For our evaluation, we aligned annotations with our Wikipedia dump (20130604) with entities replaced by their redirected titles, and entities removed if they do not exist anymore. 

In total we have 727 mentions remained as listed in the aquaint.xml.
